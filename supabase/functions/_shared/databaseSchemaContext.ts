**JOURNAL ENTRY DATABASE SCHEMA:**

Table: "${JOURNAL_ENTRY_SCHEMA.table}"

**KEY COLUMNS:**
${Object.entries(JOURNAL_ENTRY_SCHEMA.columns).map(([column, info]) => 
  `â€¢ ${column} (${info.type}): ${info.description}${info.example ? `\n  Example: ${JSON.stringify(info.example)}` : ''}`
).join('\n')}

**LANGUAGE DETECTION SYSTEM:**
- Languages are detected during transcription using multiple detection methods
- Stored as JSON array of ISO 639-1 language codes (e.g., ["en", "hi", "es"])
- Primary language is stored in original_language field
- Supports multi-language content analysis and filtering
- Translation results are stored in translation_text field

**EMOTION SCORING SYSTEM:**
- Emotions are PRE-CALCULATED using advanced AI analysis
- Scores range from 0.0 (not present) to 1.0 (strongly present)
- Typical threshold for significance: 0.3+
- DO NOT attempt to infer emotions from text - use the provided scores

**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:**
- Sentiment scores are calculated using Google Natural Language API
- Scores range from -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive)
- Stored as text in the sentiment column
- Scores >= 0.3 are considered positive
- Scores >= -0.1 and < 0.3 are considered neutral
- Scores < -0.1 are considered negative

**MASTER THEMES:**
- AI-extracted main topics and themes from journal entries
- Useful for categorical analysis and pattern recognition
- Examples: "work stress", "family relationships", "health concerns"

**SEARCH CAPABILITIES:**
${JOURNAL_ENTRY_SCHEMA.searchCapabilities.map(cap => `â€¢ ${cap}`).join('\n')}

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
${JOURNAL_ENTRY_SCHEMA.relationships.map(rel => `â€¢ ${rel}`).join('\n')}

**IMPORTANT ANALYSIS NOTES:**
- All emotion data is pre-calculated and stored as numerical scores
- Use "refined text" as primary content source when available
- Master themes provide categorical context for grouping and analysis
- Vector embeddings enable semantic similarity search
- Date filtering supports temporal pattern analysis
- Sentiment analysis uses Google NL API for accurate sentiment scoring
- Language detection supports multi-language journaling and content analysis
- Translation capabilities preserve original language context while enabling cross-language analysis

export function getEmotionAnalysisGuidelines(): string {
  return `
**EMOTION ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**

1. **Use Pre-Calculated Scores Only**
   - Emotion scores are already computed and stored in the emotions JSONB column
   - Each emotion has a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0
   - NEVER attempt to infer emotions from text snippets

2. **Significance Thresholds**
   - Scores > 0.7: Strongly present emotion
   - Scores 0.4-0.7: Moderately present emotion  
   - Scores 0.3-0.4: Weakly present emotion
   - Scores < 0.3: Generally not significant

3. **Common Emotions in Database**
   - anxiety, worry, stress, fear (negative cluster)
   - joy, happiness, excitement, contentment (positive cluster)
   - sadness, depression, loneliness, grief (melancholic cluster)
   - anger, frustration, irritation (anger cluster)
   - hope, optimism, gratitude (aspirational cluster)

4. **Analysis Approach**
   - Focus on quantitative patterns and trends
   - Reference specific scores when discussing emotions
   - Compare emotional intensity across time periods
   - Identify emotional progression and changes
`;

export function getThemeAnalysisGuidelines(): string {

**THEME ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**

1. **Master Themes Structure**
   - Stored as an array of strings in master_themes column

   - Themes are AI-extracted and semantically meaningful

2. **Common Theme Categories**
   - Work/Career: "work stress", "career development", "job satisfaction"
   - Relationships: "family relationships", "friendships", "romantic relationships"
   - Health: "mental health", "physical health", "wellness"
   - Personal Growth: "self-improvement", "learning", "goals"
   - Lifestyle: "hobbies", "travel", "daily routine"

3. **Theme-Based Analysis**
   - Use themes for categorical grouping and pattern recognition
   - Identify dominant life areas and concerns
   - Track theme evolution over time
   - Correlate themes with emotional patterns

2. **Sentiment Categories**
   - Positive: >= 0.3
   - Neutral: >= -0.1 and < 0.3
   - Negative: < -0.1
